# My_Markdown_CSS
My custom CSS and script for converting Markdown to HTML. This is hard coded, and barely working, so please don't expect much

## How to run it
```bash
./mdToHtml.sh [Markdown file]
```
It will generate the `css` folder and the **html file** in the same folder that the markdown file

## Requirements
- `pandoc`
- `neovim`
- `sed`
## Credits
- [Github Markdown CSS](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css) which is under the MIT License, and so my custom CSS
